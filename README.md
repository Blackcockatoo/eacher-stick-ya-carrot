# eacher-stick-ya-carrot

Teacher-facing "Stick Ya Carrot" game (B$S palette). React + Vite + Tailwind + framer-motion + lucide icons. No App.css (StyleInjector/Tailwind only). LocalStorage-safe.

Current prototype shows a grouped checklist with spacious spacing and a
"More" menu that tucks away export and settings actions.

Now includes CSV/HTML export and JSON import with a delete-all confirm.
